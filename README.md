# jeopardy

The goal of this project was to recreate the game Jeopardy using a mySQL database. The project was constructed using php and a mySQL database. The questions and answer information was stored in the database and php scripts were used to query the database to generate the information that fills the board. An admin can also login and create new rounds with new questions and answers using the mySQL database.
